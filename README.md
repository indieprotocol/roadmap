# Official Roadmap Declaration for *Indie Protocol*

As formal *Indie Protocol* core token shareholders we are responsible to one another for maintaining integrity among our culture and core values around *Indie Protocol* hence we had formed a group of *Indie Protocol* developers and believers; a great team of visionaries and developers developing the project using official GitHub page [IndieProtocol](https://github.com/indieprotocol) while addressing project's features and functions over main official website [IndieProtocol.GitHub.io](https://indieprotocol.github.io) and addressing the vision and mission of the *DecentraWise* at community website [DecentraWise](https://decentrawise.com) in order to develop and maintain this great project and it's continuous products and innovations.

*DecentraWise* was formed as an independent and decentralized organization, and has the best interests of *Indie Protocol* at heart. We address *Indie Protocol* as a decentralized “Blockchain as Organization” (BaO); a financial innovation in which users incorporate with Blockchain in order to produce a secure and reliable decentralized financial enterprise and FinTech ecosystem.

## *DecentraWise* Vision and Mission

*Indie Protocol* is described by *DecentraWise* as an industrial-grade decentralized Web 3.0 platform built for high-performance financial means and smart contracts operations, *Indie Protocol* enables its core token shareholders to decide its future financial products and decide how existing products work, *Indie Protocol* had successfully implemented several financial technology products such as (Utility Token, Cryptocurrencies, Stocks, Treasury Operations, Collaterals Risk Management Operations, Margin Trading Platform and Commodities Management System). Unlike traditional financial platforms, users of *Indie Protocol* have complete control over their values and financial means over *Indie Protocol*, which cannot be changed, frozen or seized by any third-party. In addition to allowing *Indie Protocol* users to trade their own financial means, *Indie Protocol* offers a wide range of built-in features and functions including User Issued Asset (UIA), Market Pegged Asset (MPA), Decentralized Exchange Engine (DEX), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), financial derivatives, loans, liquidity pools, Automated Market Maker (AMM), prediction market, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Hashed Time-lock Contract (HTLC), voting, and much more.

*DecentraWise* vision is to integrate corporate investors, companies, share holders, business assets and other financial means into a unified Open Source Blockchain ecosystem which makes financial features and functions more efficient, transparent and reliable to it’s users, Corporate shares are heavily regulated by the SEC, but none of those regulations prevent them from being issued or traded on an alternative trading system. The regulations in many jurisdictions require all shares to be registered (aka held by known identities). *Indie Protocol* corporate shares can be used as collateral for a bond or be used in any number of smart contracts.

*DecentraWise* is acting as an educational resource which designed to help users to understand *Indie Protocol* and below key concepts:

1) Describe and explain *Indie Protocol* and utility token use cases.
2) Help developers to build on top of *Indie Protocol* with development materials and programming libraries. 
3) Ensure economical security to *Indie Protocol* utility and secure eco-system participants.
4) Maintain *Indie Protocol* on going development, updates, channels high availability and future scalability.
5) Provide showcase resources created by the community and address their best deployment scenarios.
6) Maintain *Indie Protocol* documentation and help resources.

## *DecentraWise* culture and core principles

Trust: We believe trust is foundational to our mission and building trust is a slow, steady process. Trust is hard-earned and easily lost.

Relationships: We believe in close working relationships with developers and organizations that build on and contribute to the *Indie Protocol*.

Resources: We value maintaining and allocating scarce resources and support to compete on an equal playing field with other foundations in achieving our goals.

*DecentraWise* is at the heart of this: we need to not just serve the *Indie Protocol* community, but work with them and incorporate their feedback. 

*DecentraWise* isn't just the only community behind the development of Indie Protocol, as we must remember that our community is global, containing people from many languages, regions, and cultures.

*Indie Protocol* is always evolving, so [DecentraWise](https://decentrawise.com) will too. That's why the site has a simple design system & modular structure. We make iterative changes as we learn more about how people use the group site and what the community wants from it.
